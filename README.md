# RayLibGame

# Dependencies
- MSVC
- CMake
- RayLib (included in the project so don't worry)

# How to build?
Step 1: Git clone the repository

Step 2: Open the RayLibGame in VS Code as a folder

Step 3: Hit F7 or type in the command palette "CMake: Build"

Step 4 (Optional but recommended): Go into the CMakeLists.txt file and hit CTRL + S to save and generate the c_cpp_properties.json in your .vscode directory to prevent unnecessary red squiggly lines. Keep in mind this is included in the project so this isn't "required" to do right now

Step 5: When you receive this prompt, select "Unspecified" so that CMake can decide for us

Step 6: Once you receive a message like "Build finished" in the output, hit F5 and this will run the program and open the game in a window

# Build Tips
- Keep in mind that F5 and F7 are default keybindings for VS Code/CMake and you may be using a different keybind (F7 is build and F5 is run)

# TODO
- Add Box2D for the physics engine [Box2D Documentation](https://box2d.org/documentation/)
